# DETR based on Detectron2

## Disclaimer
* I haven't test the functionality, but it should be work.
* I haven't add RandomCrop.
* I haven't add support for segmentaion, but it can be easily added. 

## Advantage
* Training faster
* Avoid memory leaking in official implementation
* Use backbone in detectron2
